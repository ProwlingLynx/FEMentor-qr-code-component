### Deployment
[Live Site](https://prowlinglynx.github.io/FEMentor-qr-code-component/)
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### What I learned
I learned that when starting a simple project I tend to get sloppy with planning my approach. I realize now that even a little bit of planning would have helped in avoiding some embarassing mistakes.

I also learned that css organization is just as important for readability like other languages. I was able to brute force my way in this instance because of the small size of this project. If the project was larger I would have had trouble finding and updating the css I needed.

### Continued development

I did not need any additional build tools or Javascript for this project, but it showed that I will need to focus on plain css instead of using frameworks like bootstrap. I also will endeavour to plan my approach better for a more efficient workflow.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used this site to look up css properties and examples in their use. I prefer it over MDN because of ascetics and the minimal detail provided.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - My go to documentation for most things web development. It provides a lot of detail and code examples. However, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of information provided if you aren't sure what you are looking for.
